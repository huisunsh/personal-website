I am an Assistant Professor of Organization Theory in the [Management Department](https://www.frankfurt-school.de/en/home/research/departments/management.html) at the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management. 

My research focuses on how cognition and language affect organizational strategy-making and network mobilization. More information can be found on my CV {{< staticref "files/HuiSUN_CV.pdf" "newtab" >}} {{< icon name="download" pack="fas" >}} {{< /staticref >}}.

- <u>Cognition X Organization Learning</u>: I combine computational modeling and qualitative methods to understand how to strategize effectively with small histories in highly uncertain environments.
- <u>Cognition X Network Mobilization</u>: I study how individuals' mental organization of their social networks affects their mobilization of network resources.

As a mixed-methods scholar, I combine quantitative, qualitative, computational, and experimental methods. You can find resources on automating surveys (Javascript), interactive network analysis (R), and network learning experiments (Python) on my [Github](https://github.com/huisunsh).

I received my PhD in Management & Organizations from [Northwestern Kellogg](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/). Before Northwestern, I obtained my B.S. in Experimental Psychology and B.A. in Digital Entertainment Design from Tsinghua University. I had a wonderful time doing research on cognitive modeling in [Dr. Cleotilde (Coty) Gonzalez](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/people/faculty/cleotilde-gonzalez.html)'s Dynamic Decision Making Lab at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/).

When I am offline, I have fun playing [pipa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipa) and cello.
