I am a Ph.D. candidate from the [Management & Organizations Department](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/academics/management-and-organizations.aspx) at Kellogg School of Management. My research interests include organizational search and learning, cognitive science, and social networks. I use a mix of qualitative data, 	computational modeling, and lab experiments. Prior to graduate school, I was a member of the [Dynamic Decision Making Lab](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/ddmlab/) at the Department of Social and Decision Sciences (SDS) at Carnegie Mellon University.
